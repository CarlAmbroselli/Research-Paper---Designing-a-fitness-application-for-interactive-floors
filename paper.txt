Fitness Floor (or how was the name?)


## Abstract (Marvin)
- Summary of your findings

We introduce a jump 'n' run game for interactive floors to maintain body fitness. Players control themselves directly by stepping, jumping or laying on the floor. 

In a forrest, users jump over fallen trees or cross an ocean by holding themselves on ice floes. Repairing a bridge in shortage of time or similar complex tasks pack fitness exercises in an exciting adventure. This motivates users to do regular physical activity.

#### Instantly start game
We had several iterations when to start a workout. Ideas like special locations like fitness mat turned out to be bad since the user did not understand them when testing with a paper prototype. In the final version we chose to start the game as soon as someone starts running on the floor to provide the simplest solution as possible. 

During heuristic evaluation we identified that there must be a short message telling the user that he should start running, from that point on he understood how to start a workout and make progress.

## Conclusions (Carl)
- What have you learned about the problem domain
- Abstract insights about floor and feet and how to design for them

When designing applications for interactive floors, user studies and exploration with prototypes becomes extremely imporant since there are no general pattern and the problem domain is yet unexplored. During the process our evaluation of the user's needs changed radically. When asking users what they wanted they looked at existing solutions and tried to map them to the floor. If we had followed those we would have ended with a fitness mat and a video player since this is the known current solution for people who want to do fitness without any sport equipment. Therefore we collected important aspects from users like the need of motivation and the shortage of time and mapped them to possible exersices on the floor. Finally we came to the conclusion, that games are the most interactive soltution that motivated the users by having fun when working out. The ability to challenge your high score pushes your goals and shows you your progress. 
Since developing an interactive protoype for a floor requires a major amount of work, paper prototyping turned out to be a powerful tool to find design flaws in your prototypes as users were able to imagine the system.
In addition, even when users want to use an application to do fitness activity, they look for the simplest solution to solve a game. Therefore you need to design fitness games that force users to do certain activity with the desired path instead of giving them the freedom how they want to solve a certain task.
